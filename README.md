# E-Commerce

## Overview
Following the MVC software structure, this e-commerce store allows users to interact with a fully functional Vue.js front-end which uses JDBC to connect API requests via Java backend.
## Technologies and Software
Java, Vue3, Javascript, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL
VS Code, IntelliJ, Postman, PgAdmin
## Features
- Responsive Web Design: Users can easily navigate and engage with the website on all devices. Item cards are highlighted when users hover. 
- Login/Logout: The landing page displays a welcome message asking viewers to log in or register to use the cart feature. The login/logout link toggles depending on the status. New users can register for a new account. Returning users will find their cart just the way they left it.
- Table, Card, or Detail View: Viewers can use an icon to toggle between a card or table list view of the product, SKU, and price. The table view does not show item images. Clicking on the product will open a detailed item view.
- Message Alerts: Users will receive a pop-up confirmation message when an item is added or removed from the cart or the entire cart is emptied with the "Clear Cart" button.
## Project Takeaways
Not only was this my first Vue project, it was my first full-stack project. I am very proud of what I learned and how far it has come.  Seeing how the backend, database, and front end all come together with a usable interface. All components were built in isolation across months of learning. I learned how important it is to plan the whole project from the beginning with milestones including an MVP and a hierarchy of nice-to-have features.  My big lightbulb moment was when I drew a parallel between the Vue components and object-oriented programming (mainly encapsulation and inheritance). This allowed me to reframe how I was approaching the project. If I were to restart, I would have a much better launching point and a more comprehensive plan, and a cleaner execution. 
## What's next
- While this project is fully functional, I would like to continue refactoring and iterating to improve the user experience. Future features include a wishlist and a timed-out alert window.
